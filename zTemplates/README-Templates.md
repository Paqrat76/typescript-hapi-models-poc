# FHIR Data Model Templated

The template files in this directory are text files that contain selected methods and related code blocks to be used
when handcrafting additional FHIR resource data models classes. They evolved from some early efforts to provide sample
data type methods that could be copied/pasted into handcrafted FHIR resource data models.

These templates will be used when creating the remaining handcrafted FHIR resource data models in order to provide a
consistent and repeatable process for defining the necessary class properties and associated methods. Using these
templates will also validate that the code blocks are correct for each of the scenarios. The ultimate goal is to inform
the creation of actual templates to be used in generating all FHIR resource data models.
