# FHIR Models

## CAUTION

> These FHIR data models have been handcrafted to eventually inform the definition of code generator templates.
> They have evolved based on testing and lessons learned. Every attempt is/has been made to keep these data models
> current with the fixes and lessons learned.
> At any point in time, there might be a lag as to when those changes are made.

Refer to [README-Templates.md](../zTemplates/README-Templates.md) for the current state of documentation for the
code generator templates.
Refer to [README-TestModels.md](../test-models/README-TestModels.md) for the comprehensive test data model that
makes use of these templates.
